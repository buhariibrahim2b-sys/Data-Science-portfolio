## Data Science Portfolio (Student Performance Analysis)

Welcome to my data science portfolio. This repository contains hands-on projects demonstrating my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning using real-world datasets.


##  Project Overview
This project explores student exam performance using a real-world dataset and applies machine learning techniques to predict math scores based on reading and writing performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Compared performance across gender and parental education
- Identified strong correlation between reading and writing scores
- Analyzed score distributions and outliers

##  Machine Learning Model
- Model: Multiple Linear Regression
- Features: Reading score, Writing score
- Target: Math score

##  Results
- Strong correlation between reading and writing scores
- Model demonstrated good predictive performance

##  Dataset
Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)

## 🎯 Key Takeaway
Reading and writing scores are strong predictors of math performance.
